# What I Actually Do (Besides Drinking Coffee ☕)

> "Making LLMs less 'maybe' and more 'measurably awesome' since 2023"

## 🎯 The "LLMs That Don't Lie to You" Department

At the intersection of language models and business logic, I focus on **making LLM applications predictable, measurable, and actionable**.

| Problem | My Solution | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| "Why did the AI say that?" | Built end-to-end tracking systems | Teams get **insights**, not excuses |
| "Is this RAG any good?" | Evaluation frameworks that actually measure things | No more vibes-based development |
| "How do we trust this?" | Systematic measurement & reasoning tools | Surprises → **Confidence** |

## 🤖 Agent Highlights (AKA "The Boring Stuff I Made Fun")

**Internal Python Docs Wizard** 🧙‍♂️  
*Because reading legacy code shouldn't feel like archaeology*  
Empowering engineers to navigate complex codebases effortlessly.

**JIRA Velocity Engine**  
Previous time: 3 hours of clicking & scrolling  
New time: `<60 seconds`  
What it does: Crunches updates, discussions, and ticket histories  
Sanity preserved: ✅

## 🛠️ Dev Tools That Don't Suck
```python
def my_approach():
    """Auto-generate these docstrings.
    Better docs = smarter LLMs.
    Smarter LLMs = happier devs."""
    return "It's the circle of life 🦁"
```

**What I've Shipped:**
- 📝 **Auto docstring generation** → Documentation that writes itself (mostly)
- 🔌 **Claude Skills Marketplace** → Plug-and-play AI capabilities for internal repos
- 🎨 **Storybook-driven UI** → Design components iteratively, not chaotically
- 🚀 **CI/CD migrations** (Jenkins → GitHub Actions) → Goodbye, XML nightmares
- ⚡ **Node 20 firmwide migration** → Modern runtimes, modern problems solved

## 🏗️ Platform & Infrastructure (The Unsexy Stuff That Matters)

> "Someone's gotta modernize the stack, might as well make it elegant"
```bash
# Before
$ jenkins build --pray --sacrifice-goat
# After  
$ gh workflow run deploy.yml ✨
```

**Key Wins:**
- Migrated multiple teams to modern CI/CD → Better reliability, faster deploys
- Upgraded firmwide apps to Node 20 → Unlocked performance & security wins
- Built reusable business components → 10x'd UI development speed

## 🎨 UI & Content Systems (Making Things Pretty *and* Functional)

**WYSIWYG Web Editor**  
Fully compatible with Microsoft content systems because... enterprise, baby 📊

**Reusable Component Library**  
Built once, shipped everywhere. The IKEA model, but for React components.

## 📢 Occasional Thought Leadership (AKA "I Talk Good")

*"Here's how RAG actually works"* – Internal tech talks on building effective RAG systems  
*"No, you don't need to rewrite everything"* – CI/CD migration best practices  
*"Let me show you the eval pipeline"* – Team enablement & LLM integration patterns  

| Topic | Format | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| RAG Systems Deep Dive | Tech Talk | Teams shipping production RAG |
| CI/CD Best Practices | Workshop | 3 teams migrated in Q1 |
| LLM Evaluation Pipelines | Hands-on Session | Org-wide eval standards |

**Current status:** Helping teams ship AI features without the existential dread.  
**Stack overflow visits per day:** Still too many  
**Bugs created vs fixed ratio:** We don't talk about that 🤫
