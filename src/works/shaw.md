### What I Work On (Beyond Meetings & Pull Requests)

> *Turning LLMs from “it kinda works” into systems you can **reason about, trust, and improve***  

This section summarizes my impact at the intersection of **LLMs, developer productivity, and platform modernization**—with just enough personality to keep it human.

#### 🧠 Making LLM Systems Explainable & Measurable

I focus on building **LLM-powered systems that behave predictably**, and more importantly, **tell you *why* they behaved a certain way**.

##### What that looks like in practice:
- **RAG evaluation frameworks**  
  Measuring retrieval quality, grounding, and answer usefulness—so decisions aren’t based on vibes.
- **End-to-end observability for LLM apps**  
  Tracking prompts, retrieval context, responses, and downstream effects to answer:
  > “Why did the model do that?”
- **Reasoning-first design**  
  Treating LLMs as *systems*, not magic APIs—designed for iteration, debugging, and confidence.

**Outcome:**  
Teams move from *trial-and-error prompting* to **measurable, explainable AI behavior**.

#### 🤖 Agents & Apps That Actually Save Time

##### 🧙 Internal Python Documentation Wizard  
Helps engineers understand large, legacy Python codebases quickly—without spelunking through files.

- Natural-language exploration of internal libraries
- Context-aware explanations tied to real code
- Dramatically reduced onboarding and “who knows this?” pings

##### ⚡ JIRA Search & Crunch Engine  
What used to take **hours of manual searching** now takes **under a minute**.

- Summarizes ticket updates, discussions, and history
- Pulls signal from noisy comment threads
- Designed for fast decision-making, not reporting theater

#### 🛠️ Developer Tooling Upgrades

Better tools → better docs → better LLM outputs.

##### Key Contributions:
- **Auto docstring generation**  
  Consistent, high-quality documentation that benefits both humans *and* LLM-based tooling.
- **Claude Skill Set & Internal Marketplace**  
  Reusable AI capabilities teams can plug into their repos without re-inventing workflows.
- **Storybook-driven UI development**  
  Component-first development that improves quality, velocity, and design collaboration.

---

#### 🏗️ Platform & Infrastructure Work (The Quiet Multipliers)

Not flashy, but foundational.

##### 🚀 Modernization Efforts
- **Firmwide migration to Node 20**  
  Improved performance, security posture, and runtime consistency.
- **Jenkins → GitHub Actions migrations**  
  Helped multiple teams move to simpler, more maintainable CI/CD pipelines.

**Impact:**
- Faster builds & deploys
- Less operational friction
- Fewer “only one person knows how this works” systems

---

#### 🎨 UI & Content Systems

Building UI foundations that scale across teams and use cases.

- **Reusable business component library**  
  Shared, composable components that significantly reduce duplicate work.
- **WYSIWYG web editor**  
  Designed to be compatible with Microsoft content systems—bridging modern web UX with enterprise constraints.

---

#### 📢 Knowledge Sharing & Technical Leadership

I spend a meaningful amount of time helping teams level up—not just shipping code.

##### Internal Talks & Enablement
- **Building effective RAG systems**  
  Practical guidance on retrieval strategies, evaluation, and failure modes.
- **CI/CD migration best practices**  
  How to modernize pipelines without disrupting delivery.
- **LLM integration patterns & eval pipelines**  
  Helping teams adopt LLMs responsibly, with clear quality signals.

| Area | Format | Outcome |
|-----|------|--------|
| RAG Systems | Tech Talks | Teams shipping production-grade RAG |
| CI/CD | Workshops | Multiple team migrations completed |
| LLM Evaluation | Hands-on Sessions | Shared org-wide patterns |

#### Current Focus

- Helping teams ship LLM features **with confidence**
- Reducing ambiguity in AI-driven systems
- Raising the baseline for developer experience and platform reliability

*Less guesswork. More signal. Fewer late-night debugging sessions.*
