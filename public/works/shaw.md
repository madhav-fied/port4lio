## Contributions at D.E.Shaw & Co.,

```
I had the opportunity to work accross multiple teams and projects ranging from platform
upgrades to JS ecosystem to Generative AI and learnt a lot through the projects that I successfully executed.
```


#### Major projects and outcomes
**1. AI Infrastructure & Evaluation**
- **E2E Evaluation pipeline**
> Built an end-to-end pipeline starting from creating a dataset, evaluating intermediate responses, and
finally storing and visualizing periodic results to track performance improvements or degradation
- **Observability for LLM apps**
> Hosted a platform where users can trace all the intermediate steps that an Agent/LLM has taken to arrive at a
particular result

**Outcome:** Onboarded 6+ internal products to move from *trial-and-error methods* to **measurable AI behavior**. 

**2. Agents & LLM apps for productivity**
- **Agent that crunches data from internal ticketing system**
> Built an agent that is clever enough to fetch and present data effectively from over 100+ requests that require
over 2+ hours of manual work for power users within a minute
- **Internal Python Assistant**
> Built an agent that is well-versed in answering queries about internal python libraries with an accuracy of over 70%
- **Auto documentation generating app**
> Collaborated in building an app that generates docstrings for JS, Python, or Java code deterministically via ASTs

**3. Platform & Infrastructure**
- **Client library and utilities to access and build LLM apps**
> Maintain and build python utilities that help business teams connect to LLM Gateway and build apps
- **Move CI and CD infrastructure from Jenkins to GitHub Actions**
> Facilitated shared actions and collaborated with multiple teams to demonstrate and establish their GitHub
workflows post deprecation of Jenkins
- **Firmwide migration to Node 20**
> Upgraded to Node 20 from Node 16, ensuring all existing systems remain intact and also addressed queries from teams

**4. UI/UX components & content systems**
- 3+ Business components to Firmwide UI library
> Added and contributed enhancements to a firmwide reusable library for frontend components in React
- Contributions to an internal WYSIWYG web editor component
> Added a floating menu to enable quick edits on text selection
> Ensured content compatibility with Microsoft content systems backed by thorough tests

**5. Appendix: Knowledge Sharing & Leadership**

- Led and conducted tech-talks that help in other teams gaining more AI and Infrastruce potentials.
